## News :fire:
- Upcoming: More tasks will be added to ClearVoice.
- [2025.5] Updated speechscore with more non-intrusive metrics: NISQA and DISTILL_MOS
- [2025.4] Updated pip installation for [ClearVoice](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/clearvoice). Now you can simply type `pip install clearvoice` to use all the pretrained models in ClearVoice, see project description in PyPi [link](https://pypi.org/project/clearvoice/).
- [2025.4] Added a training script for speech super-resolution, supporting both retraining and fine-tuning of models. For details, refer to the documentation [here](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/train/speech_super_resolution).
- [2025.4] Added data generation scripts for training/finetuning speech enhancement models. The scripts generate either noisy speech or noisy-reverberant speech. Please check [here](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/train/data_generation/speech_enhancement).
- [2025.1] ClearVoice demo is ready for try on both [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/spaces/alibabasglab/ClearVoice) and [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/studios/iic/ClearerVoice-Studio). However, HuggingFace has limited GPU usage, and ModelScope has more GPU usage quota.
- [2025.1] ClearVoice now offers **speech super-resolution**, also known as bandwidth extension. This feature improves the perceptual quality of speech by converting low-resolution audio (with an effective sampling rate of at least 16,000 Hz) into high-resolution audio with a sampling rate of 48,000 Hz. A full upscaled **LJSpeech-1.1-48kHz dataset** can be downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/alibabasglab/LJSpeech-1.1-48kHz) and [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/iic/LJSpeech-1.1-48kHz).
- [2025.1] ClearVoice now supports more audio formats including **"wav", "aac", "ac3", "aiff", "flac", "m4a", "mp3", "ogg", "opus", "wma", "webm"**, etc. It also supports both mono and stereo channels with 16-bit or 32-bit precisions. A latest version of [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) is required for audio codecs.  
- [2024.12] Upload pre-trained models on ModelScope. User now can download the models from either [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/iic/ClearerVoice-Studio/summary) or [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/alibabasglab)  
- [2024.11] Our FRCRN speech denoiser has been used over **3.0 million** times on [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/iic/speech_frcrn_ans_cirm_16k)
- [2024.11] Our MossFormer speech separator has been used over **2.5 million** times on [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/iic/speech_mossformer_separation_temporal_8k)
- [2024.11] Release of this repository

## Contents of this repository
This repository is organized into three main components: **[ClearVoice](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/clearvoice)**, **[Train](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/train)**, and **[SpeechScore](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/speechscore)**.

### 1. **ClearVoice [[Readme](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/blob/main/clearvoice/README.md)][[文档](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/blob/main/clearvoice/README.md)]**  
ClearVoice offers a user-friendly  solution for speech processing tasks such as speech denoising, separation, super-resolution, audio-visual target speaker extraction, and more. It is designed as a unified inference platform leveraged pre-trained models (e.g., [FRCRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07293), [MossFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11824)), all trained on extensive datasets. If you're looking for a tool to improve speech quality, ClearVoice is the perfect choice. Simply click on [`ClearVoice`](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/clearvoice) and follow our detailed instructions to get started.

### 2. **Train**  
For advanced researchers and developers, we provide model finetune and training scripts for all the tasks offerred in ClearVoice and more:

- **Task 1: [Speech enhancement](train/speech_enhancement)** (16kHz & 48kHz)
- **Task 2: [Speech separation](train/speech_separation)** (8kHz & 16kHz)
- **Task 2: [Speech super-resolution](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/train/speech_super_resolution)** (48kHz) 
- **Task 4: [Target speaker extraction](train/target_speaker_extraction)** 
  - **Sub-Task 1: Audio-only Speaker Extraction Conditioned on a Reference Speech** (8kHz)
  - **Sub-Task 2: Audio-visual Speaker Extraction Conditioned on Face (Lip) Recording** (16kHz)
  - **Sub-Task 3: Audio-visual Speaker Extraction Conditioned on Body Gestures** (16kHz)
  - **Sub-Task 4: Neuro-steered Speaker Extraction Conditioned on EEG Signals** (16kHz)

Contributors are welcomed to include more model architectures and tasks!

### 3. **SpeechScore [[Readme](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/blob/main/speechscore/README.md)][[文档](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/blob/main/speechscore/README.md)]**  
<a href="https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/speechscore">`SpeechScore`<a/> is a speech quality assessment toolkit. We include it here to evaluate different model performance. SpeechScore includes many popular speech metrics:

- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ)
- Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI)
- Deep Noise Suppression Mean Opinion Score (DNSMOS)
- Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR)
- and many more quality benchmarks
